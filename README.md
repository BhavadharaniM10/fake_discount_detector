# Fake-Discount-Detector

This project analyzes Amazon product price histories to detect potentially fake discounts using a combination of rule-based logic and machine learning. It supports both historical evaluation and real-time user-entered price analysis.

---

## Features
- Detects fake discounts using historical price patterns  
- Supports real-time mode with user-entered current and claimed original prices  
- Computes key metrics: **drop %**, **volatility score**, **ML anomaly score**  
- Annotated price history chart with spikes, drop lines, and user markers  
- Streamlit UI for interactive analysis

## Detection Logic

### Historical Mode
Used when the evaluation date exists in the dataset.

**Conditions for Detection:**
- At least **5 records** in the recent window (default: last 90 days)  
- Claimed original price ≥ current price  

**Detection Outcomes:**
| Status         | Conditions                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Genuine**        | Drop % < threshold (e.g. 20%), no spike, low volatility                   |
| **Suspicious**     | Drop % ≥ threshold, spike detected, high volatility                       |
| **No Discount**    | Claimed original < current price                                          |
| **Limited Data**   | Fewer than 5 records in recent window                                     |

### Real-Time Mode (Today)
Used when user enters today’s price manually.

**Conditions for Detection:**
- At least **3 records** in the recent window (relaxed threshold)  
- Claimed original price ≥ current price  

**Detection Outcomes:**
| Status         | Conditions                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Genuine**        | Drop % < threshold, no spike, low volatility                              |
| **Suspicious**     | Drop % ≥ threshold, spike detected, high volatility                       |
| **No Discount**    | Claimed original < current price                                          |
| **Limited Data**   | Fewer than 3 records in recent window                                     |

**Additional Notes:**
- Today’s price is plotted above the last dataset date to avoid chart gaps  
- Explanation includes anchoring note: **"Dataset ends on YYYY-MM-DD. Today’s evaluation is anchored to that date, so results are approximate."**

## Key Metrics
- **Drop %**: `(claimed_original - current_price) / claimed_original`  
- **Volatility Score**: Coefficient of variation in recent window  
- **ML Anomaly Score**: Isolation Forest score (higher = more abnormal)  
- **Spike Detection**: Rolling z-score > 2.0

## Chart Annotations
- Blue line: Daily Mean Price  
- Red dot: Today’s Price (user-entered)  
- Green triangle: Claimed Original Price  
- Red dashed line: Claimed Drop  
- Pink shaded area: Drop Region  
- Purple star: Detected Spike

## Testing Tips
To test today mode:
- Use products with ≥ 3 records in their last 90-day window  
- Use realistic claimed original and current prices  
- Check chart for spike markers and drop annotations  

---

## Configuration Parameters
Defined in `config.py`:
- **DROP_THRESHOLD**: % drop to flag as suspicious (default: 20%)  
- **SPIKE_Z_THRESHOLD**: z-score threshold for spike detection (default: 2.0)  
- **RECENT_WINDOW_DAYS**: window size for recent history (default: 90)

## Motto
**"Transparency First: Every discount explained, every spike exposed."**
